# Sublime Code Snippets

A collection of Sublime Text code snippets

## Installation

Until we have figured out how to set these up to install via Package Control, copy the repo to your Packages folder manually.

## TODO

* Complete readme
* Add more snippets
* Figure out how to install via Package Control

## Contributing to Sublime Code Snippets

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
